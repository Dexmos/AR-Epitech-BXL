# AR-Epitech-BXL
AR projet made with Unity AR Foundation for Epitech Brussels.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to make a little game of our choice using Unity with AR Foundation framework.
In that case, I chosed a shooter.

## Game Features

In this game, we can use **images detection** from real cards such as Pokemon or Magic cards. 
Here we are detecting **Charizard-EX** card from *Pokemon* and **Jayce, memory adept** from *Magic the Gathering*.

We can also place a gameObject on a **detected plane** and change it scale, rotation or positions.

Last, we can change rotation of the ball and **shoot** our gameObject to push it outside the detected plane !
